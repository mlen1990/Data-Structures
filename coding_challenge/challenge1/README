The operating system that this program was developed on is MAC OS X
Version 10.7.5

Instructions:
1. Setup the JDBC driver. This program will not work without it.
2. Install MySQL.
3. Open up MySQLDatabase.java and change the user name and password to the
one set on MySQL.
4. At the command line, compile the program using "javac *.java"
5. At the command line, run the program using
"java DirectoryTraversal <directory> <numThreads> <executionTime>"

Note:
1. This program intentionally ignores the directory that is passed in
as an input argument when storing files in the database i.e. only the
subdirectories in the input directory will be considered as the top level.
2. If numThreads is less than or equal to 0, an error will be printed.
The program will continue executing using a default of 5 threads.
3. The executionTime is in milliseconds.
4. If executionTime is less than or equal to 0, an error will be
printed. The program will continue executing using a default of 1000 ms.
5. This program assumes that a database table "files" does not already
exist in the set of mysql tables and creates the database table files.

How to install JDBC driver using the command line:
1. Get the full path to the folder "mysql-connector-java-5.1.26".
2. Type "export MYSQL_HOME="path/mysql-connector-java-5.1.26"
3. Type "export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:$MYSQL_HOME/mysql-connector-java-5.1.26-bin.jar:."
